# While loops

while loop can be different for example, there is the common 
```python
while True:
    print("this is the most common example")

```
but there is also the 
```python
i = 0
while i < 100:
    print("this loop can be stopped depending on i")
```
while loops can help to repeat something infinately, or for whatever amount of times
the (while true) loop makes things infinate
but, the(i = 0 or whatever number) (i < number) loop can be varied and you can alter how many times of repeats you want to do
